# For a secure host, create a file playbooks/host_vars/[hostid]
# with the secure hostname, and the locations of a key and certfile
# e.g.
# apache_https:
#   hostname: secure.at.biovel.eu
#   privateKey: secure.key
#   certificate: secure.crt
#   chainFile: chain.crt
apache_https:
  hostname: none
