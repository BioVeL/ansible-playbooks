Ansible configuration for BioVeL servers

Install Ansible
===============
Install Ansible from https://github.com/ansible/ansible

Run these commands to get a quick start installation:
$ git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git github-ansible
$ source github-ansible/hacking/env-setup

Configure ssh public key access
===============================
Setup password-less access to your hosts.  You should also have password-less
access to sudo on the host.  (If not, see the Ansible documentation for
additional flags).

Typically, this requires the command:
$ ssh-add <ssh-key>

Update the host inventory
=========================
Ensure the inventory/hosts file contains the hosts you wish to manage.

Override defaults
=================
The files contained in the repository contain default usernames and passwords 
for services and databases.  You can use these, but anyone with access to the 
Github repository will know the passwords.

For additional security, create a host_vars/<hostname> file to override these
entries.  e.g. if a host called portalhost is in the biovel-portal group, the 
default username and password for the portal's database will be obtained from
group_vars/biovel-portal.  You can create a file host_vars/portalhost with a
replacement definition.  Do not add these files to the repository!

Configure the hosts
===================
Simply run:
$ ansible-playbook -c ssh -i inventory/hosts playbooks/site.yaml
