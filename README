Ansible configuration for BioVeL servers

Install Ansible from https://github.com/ansible/ansible

Run these commands to get a quick start installation:
$ git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git github-ansible
$ source github-ansible/hacking/env-setup

Setup password-less access to your hosts. You should also have password-less access to sudo on the host.
(If not, see the Ansible documentation for additional flags).

Typically, this requires the command:
$ ssh-add <ssh-key>

Ensure the inventory/hosts file contains the hosts you wish to manage.

Configure the hosts:
$ ansible-playbook -c ssh -i inventory/hosts playbooks/site.yaml
