Ansible configuration for BioVeL servers


Configure ssh public key access
===============================
Setup password-less access to your hosts.  You should also have password-less
access to sudo on the host.  (If not, see the Ansible documentation for
additional flags).

Typically, this requires the command:
$ ssh-add <ssh-key>

Setup
=====
From the directory containing this README, run the command:
$ source setup.sh

This will install Ansible if required, and create additional files, such as a 
hosts file.

Update the host inventory
=========================
Ensure the inventory/hosts file contains the hosts you wish to manage.

Override defaults
=================
The files contained in the repository contain default usernames and passwords 
for services and databases.  You can use these, but anyone with access to the 
Github repository will know the passwords.

For additional security, copy the group_vars directory to the playbooks 
directory. e.g. inventory/group_vars -> playbooks/group_vars and override the
passwords. If a host called portalhost is in the biovel-portal group, the 
default username and password for the portal's database will be obtained from
group_vars/biovel-portal.  You can create also a file 
playbooks/host_vars/portalhost with a replacement definition.  Do not add 
these files to the repository!

Configure the hosts
===================
Simply run:
$ ansible-playbook -c ssh -i inventory/hosts playbooks/site.yaml
