To create a secure Apache server, add certificate and key files to this 
directory.

Then create a file in playbooks/host_vars named after the host entry containing
the filenames prefixed with "secure/":
e.g. if the hosts file contains:

host1.at.biovel.eu

create the file playbooks/host_vars/host1.at.biovel.eu containing:
---
apache_https:
  hostname: host1.at.biovel.eu
  privateKey: secure/host1.key
  certificate: secure/host1.crt
  chainFile: secure/chain.crt
