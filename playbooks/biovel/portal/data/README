To initialize a portal database with a data dump generated using 
"datactl.sh save...", put the data dump in this directory
(e.g. data/data-20130809T0815Z.zip).

Add a variable to the host configuration with the path to this file.
e.g. for host1 with an unitialized database, add the following variable to the 
file host_vars/host1:

biovel_portal_intial_data: data/data-20130809T0815Z.zip

Note, if the database already contains a migration marker, the contents will 
not be overwritten.  This means you can safely re-run this step, even if the 
database has been modified.
