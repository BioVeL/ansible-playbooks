        # ETags are not turned off as suggested in this link, as pages that
        # suggest doing this never seem to provide a good reason.
        #
        # Some pages suggest that there exist browsers that ignore Expires
        # when an ETag is present, but they do not name the browsers, and in
        # any case this is merely less efficient, not incorrect behaviour.
        #
        # Other pages suggest that this is a problem when files are delivered
        # by load balanced web servers, which each use a different ETag for the
        # same file, but this is a general ETag problem, unrelated to its
        # combination with Expires. And in any case, it doesn't currently
        # apply to our setup (or to a well-designed load balancing system).
        #
        # On the other hand, keeping the ETag means even the once per day check
        # is efficient, as it typically will not need to download the file.
